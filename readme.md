# ðŸ“Œ - A weekend project in web bookmarking
This is a flask app that loosely emulates the functions (and direcly emulates the look) of [Pinboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinboard_(website)) and [del.icio.us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)). Simply, it aims to:

1. Allow for the saving of URLs with titles, descriptions and tags for easy organization and retrieval
2. Provide a full-text search of items described in point 1
3. Save sharable page extracts for easy access in the late future
